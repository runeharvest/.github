Rune Harvest is an AGPLv3-licensed MMORPG project built on the RyzomCore engine.
It draws thematic and mechanical inspiration from tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons.

Planned enhancements over base RyzomCore include:

- Character progression with levels-
- Class system with unique abilities.
- Additional RPG mechanics not present in RyzomCore.
